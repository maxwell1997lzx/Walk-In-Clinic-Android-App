This app was co-developed in my software engineering class with 4 other students. My main responsibillity was implementing the back end functionallity and database component.

## Running the App
The only way to run this app is to download and run the **RUN_ME.apk**

Once you run the app you'll need to create an account to sign in! Choose an employee or patient account and start exploring the app! Remember this isn't really built to work in reality. It was built for a school project...

You won't be able to run the app from the source code as I've removed my firebase credentials. 


## DataBase Information
This project uses Google Firebase!
